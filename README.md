Created Kovaaks in Unity for Dali application

## Description
Kovaaks is an aim training game that I used to love playing and competing on with my friends.
For this project, I decided to recreate a simple version of the game.

## Application Link
Here's the playable version of the app:
[Kovaaks](kovaaks.app)

## Demo
Here's a video demo of me playing:

## Setup

## Journey
### Inspiration
Kovaaks is an aim training game that I used to love playing and competeting on with my friends.
For this project, I decided to recreate a simple version of the game.

### Impact
I hope other people take away the same lessons from playing Kovaaks that I did:
1. Games can be simple to create yet fun to play, don't let complexity stop you from building
2. The best way to appreciate the works of others is to try to recreate it yourself
3. You can create anything you desire, no matter how complicated it seems

### New Tech
Before building Kovaaks, I had 0 prior experience building games.

I learned how to use Unity, including:
- colliders
- movement
- cameras
- physics engine (Raycast)
- c#
- prefabs
- 3d design

I chose to use Unity and the associated features because 
1. Unity seemed to be the most common 3d game design tool
2. I briefly tried to build a game on unity several years ago and failed out of it so I wanted revenge

### Challenges
I faced 2 main challenges in designed Kovaaks
1. player movement
2. 3d design

##### Player Movement
The hardest part for me by far was creating the logic for the player to move. It was
completely unlike any coding I had done in the past, and all the Unity lingo + physics components
didn't help. This is where the biggest chunk of my time was spent. Although I obviously watched some
tutorials to try to learn these things, I wasn't satisfied as they would often skip over the first principles
guiding their code. It took me awhile to slowly work my way to solid understanding.

##### 3d design
Perhaps in playing my game you can see my weakness in design. However, my main difficulty was in actually
moving, transforming, and playing with objects on a tiny little macbook window with a trackpad. Really wish I had
multiple monitors and a mouse.

### Takeaways
Overall, I learned that I can create whatever I put my mind to. In the 4 day window it took me to build this app,
I went from 0 prior experience to a working game. That makes me fell good about myself and confident to try more new things
in the future.
